# Hi, I'm Camila! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I'm a full stack developer and multimedia designer.

I like painting, drawing and design, which I consider adds a creative side to my profile.

👩‍🎓 I studied Multimedia Design at Primera Escula DaVinci, not long after I graduated, I entered Henry's bootcamp, where i learned HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React, Redux, NodeJs, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL.

I have a passion for Front-end develpment, which I belive comes from my creative side and my interest in programming.

One thing that I love about the world of programming is the fact that it's so wide, there's always something new and interesting to learn.
